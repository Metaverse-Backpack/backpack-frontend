## About The Project

The backpack frontend is a website that let's you manage your virtual backpack.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* npm

  Install npm as the service is based on React and uses npm as a package manager. *NOTE:* This installation command requires [brew](https://brew.sh/) and only runs on Mac.
  ```sh
  $ brew install node
  ```

* Backpack backend

  Please refer to the [backpack backend](https://github.com/Metaverse-Backpack/backpack-backend) and ensure that it is properly setup and running before you continue to run the backpack frontend.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/Metaverse-Backpack/backpack-frontend.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   $ npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Development

For development, the backpack frontend can be started with the following command:
```bash
# Start frontend in watch mode (automatically reload if files change)
$ npm run start
```

### Production

For production, the backpack frontend can be build with the following command:
```bash
# Build service in production mode
$ npm run build
```

It builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
